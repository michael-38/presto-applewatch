# Presto (Apple Watch)

Design for Presto (contactless smart card fare payment system) on the Apple Watch. 

Combined with Google Maps navigation functionality, this app will inform a user when to use their Presto for fare payment.

Also leveraging NFC capability of an Apple Watch, all transit commuters can pay their fare by bringing their Apple Watch device near the Presto payment machine.
